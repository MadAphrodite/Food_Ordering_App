# Food Ordering App
The company has decided to build a food ordering application that will allow contactless ordering in the restaurant (replacing the physical menu). The app must provide a customer with an overview of all the food and drink available in the restaurant, accept orders, and securely store customer data to comply with GDPR and data privacy laws. 

**Main functionalities of the app:** 
* Browsing products: viewing, searching, filtering
* Ordering products: adding/editing order and adjusting product quantities
* Order confirmation: customers receive an email summary of their order
* Managing orders: staff can mark orders as completed or declined
* Access: app works on smartphones, tablets and computer
