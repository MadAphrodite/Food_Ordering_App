# Food Ordering App
The company has decided to build a food ordering application that will allow contactless ordering in the restaurant (replacing the physical menu). The app must provide a customer with an overview of all the food and drinks available in the restaurant, accept orders, and securely store customer data to comply with data privacy laws. The goal of the project is to build a simple application for a small pizza restaurant, that could simplify ordering for customers.  

**Main functionalities of the app:** 
* Menu browsing with search
* Previewing products
* Ordering products
* Login to the administration panel
* Admin: viewing and managing orders
* Admin: product management

## My responsibilities and highlights during the project
* Studying software development methodologies(Agile, Scrum) and basics of software testing
* Writing testing checklists based on use cases in Confluence
* Conducting use case and regression testing
* Reporting found bugs to Jira
* Reviewing other team’s work and writing constructive feedback
