# Food Ordering App
The company has decided to build a food ordering application that will allow contactless ordering in the restaurant (replacing the physical menu). The app must provide a customer with an overview of all the food and drinks available in the restaurant, accept orders, and securely store customer data to comply with data privacy laws. The goal of the project is to build a simple application for a small pizza restaurant, that could simplify ordering for customers.  

**Main functionalities of the app:** 
* Browsing products: viewing, searching, filtering
* Ordering products: adding/editing order and adjusting product quantities
* Order confirmation: customers receive an email summary of their order
* Managing orders: staff can mark orders as completed or declined
* Access: app works on smartphones, tablets and computer
