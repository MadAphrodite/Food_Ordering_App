# Food Ordering App
The company has decided to build a food ordering application that will allow contactless ordering in the restaurant (replacing the physical menu). The app must provide a customer with an overview of all the food and drink available in the restaurant, accept orders, and securely store customer data to comply with GDPR and data privacy laws.
